After doing some machine learning projects using public datasets I decided I needed a new challenge: build a predictive model for college basketball games. The end goal that I wanted to accomplish with this project was to use machine learning algorithms and advanced analytics metrics to determine which team will win every basketball game between NCAA division I teams
