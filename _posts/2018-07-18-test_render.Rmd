**Title test**
This is a test of making an R script and using rmarkdown::render() to convert it to a markdown document that can be easily uploaded to a blog page. Lets add some data to test how it works.



```{r }
a <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3)


data(mtcars)
plot(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$hp)
abline(lm(mtcars$mpg ~ mtcars$hp), col = 'red')
```
