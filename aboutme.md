By day I'm a research scientist who uses R to analyze bioinformatics data but by night I use those skills to analyze sports data. My main interests are in analyzing efficiency of college football and NFL teams but sometimes I venture into other sports. 

My favorite teams are the Michigan Wolverines, Georgia Bulldogs, and Detroit Lions. Between the three of them I've witnessed every type of heartbreaking loss you can imagine.
